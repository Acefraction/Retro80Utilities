## Semantic Dither Palette Generation Pipeline

### ▶ Purpose

To mathematically generate a visually natural 16-color representative palette from subjective keywords such as "space" or "spring sunset."

---

### ▶ Process Overview

1. **Image Processing**: Generate Lab color space histograms from user-created illustrations (multiple images required).
2. **Keyword Recognition**: User inputs a term such as "space."
3. **Hue Range Definition**: Define the corresponding HSL hue range for the word (e.g., "space" → 220°–300°).
4. **Lab Data Filtering**: Extract color points that match the hue range.
5. **KMeans Clustering**: Analyze the remaining color points in Lab space and group into 16 representative colors.
6. **Convert to RGB/Palette Format**: Output results as HEX codes or sorted by lightness.

### ▶ Implementation Notes & Terminology

| Step             | Description                              |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Image Conversion | RGB → Lab (L\*, a\*, b\*)                |
| Hue Calculation  | Lab → RGB → HSL to obtain H value        |
| Hue Matching     | Filter only where 220° ≤ H ≤ 300°        |
| KMeans           | sklearn.cluster.KMeans(n=16)             |
| Output Format    | HEX color codes, RGB palette, Lab values |

### ▶ Use Cases

* High-color dithering palette
* Scene-based preset generation
* Character-specific color tuning
* Color perception diagnostics tool

---

### ▶ Notes

* Input is "subjective language," output is "mathematically beautiful 16 colors."
* ab distribution = reflects creator's personality
* L\* distribution = represents atmosphere/lightness
* Language × Color × Statistical Processing = the best "smart algorithm"
